# Learning Journey 2025

Welcome to my learning journey repository!

## Purpose

This repository documents my structured approach to reinforcing, formalizing, and expanding my knowledge as a developer. While some material included here may be foundational or rudimentary—and therefore briefly covered or skipped—my primary goal is to thoroughly revisit the fundamentals and address any gaps, misconceptions, or advanced topics I've encountered throughout my journey.

Essentially, this repository represents my commitment to mastering both foundational and advanced web development concepts and provides transparency into my learning process.

## What's Included?

- **Course notes**: Summaries and insights from various courses I've completed or am actively studying.
- **Practice projects**: Select exercises and examples demonstrating my understanding.
- **Advanced concepts**: Exploration into more complex topics, theory, and technologies encountered.

## Courses Covered (or Planned)

- **TypeScript**
- **Full-Stack Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)**
- **Next.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL (Ecommerce)**
- **SQL and Database Fundamentals**
- **MongoDB and NoSQL Databases**
- **Advanced Database Engineering**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Figma UI/UX Design**

This list may evolve over time as I identify new areas to explore or as priorities shift during my development journey.

## Why I'm Doing This

Though I've previously built functional projects and applications, I've identified areas where my foundational understanding could be stronger. Rather than relying solely on existing knowledge, I decided to step back, reaffirm my basics, and fill in any gaps—ensuring I possess a robust and complete understanding of web development concepts.

## Final Thoughts

Feel free to explore the repository, view my notes, or provide feedback. My goal is continuous growth, improvement, and transparency in my development process.
